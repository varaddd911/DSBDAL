1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic' as used in the above problem. Plot a box plot for 
distribution of age with respect to each gender along with the information about whether 
they survived or not. (Column names : 'sex' and 'age')  
2. Write observations on the inference from the above statistics. 




import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
titanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
titanic.head()
sns.boxplot(x = 'sex', y = 'age', data = titanic)
sns.boxplot(x = 'sex', y = 'age', data = titanic, hue = 'survived')
